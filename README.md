# Electric-Vehicles-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview

This Tableau Dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of electric vehicles (EVs) data from the United States. The primary Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) focus on understanding the market landscape, technological advancements, and geographical distribution of electric vehicles, encompassing both Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 1. **Total Vehicles:**

- Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth.

### 2. **Average Electric Range:**

- Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the EVs.
 
### 3. **Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles:**

- Identify and analyze the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset.
- Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.
  
### 4. **Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles:**

- Identify and analyze the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in the dataset.
- Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, offering insights into the market share of plug-in hybrid models.
